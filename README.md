# Defna Lang (CPP Compiler)

Defna stands for Definitely Not A is (not) a programming language. 

Defna is designed to bridge the gap between pseudocode and programming languages by offering a syntax that resembles pseudocode while also being executable via a compiler. This makes Defna an ideal tool for those transitioning from conceptual coding to actual programming, enabling them to write code that is both easy to understand and capable of running on a machine.

## Building

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dimas-Saputra-Me/defna
